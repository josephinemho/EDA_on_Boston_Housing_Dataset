# EDA on Boston Housing Data
(a.k.a. Exploratory Data Analysis of the Boston Housing data)

**Inspired by the Kaggle competition: https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data**


## Outline 

Predict sales prices and practice feature engineering and random forests. 

**Goal**
It is your job to predict the sales price for each house. For each Id in the test set, you must predict the value of the SalePrice variable. 

**Metric**
Submissions are evaluated on Root-Mean-Squared-Error (RMSE) between the logarithm of the predicted value and the logarithm of the observed sales price. (Taking logs means that errors in predicting expensive houses and cheap houses will affect the result equally.)


## File and Directory Organization

```
/data - 1st iteration of project without data cleaning (our benchmark)
/ipynb - Python notebooks
/lib - source code for modules
```


## Approach

**Part 1 -- Acquire the data**<br>


**Part 2 -- Explore the data**<br>


**Part 3 -- Engineer and Transform Features and Target**<br>


**Part 4 -- Build a Model**<br>


**Part 5 -- Make Predictions**<br>



## How to Follow Along

Notebooks found in the `/ipynb` folder are labeled 1-10, representing steps taken to complete this project. Every notebook has a step number, a brief description in the title of what to expect, and are annotated with comments describing the reasoning behind what Machine Learning methodologies were used.
